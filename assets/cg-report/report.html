            we wanted to put something random into the scene: For example a car "driving" in space.

              </dd>
            </dl>

            <h3>Implementation</h3>
            <p>To load the texture images, I am using the <a href="https://github.com/nothings/stb">stb_image</a>
              library, which is already imported in <code>ext/nanogui</code>. This allows us to load png and jpg images
              into 8-bit integer arrays. <br>
              To sample a the texture, the <code>eval()</code> method takes the uv coordinates of the desired point as
              input. We then convert the uv coordinates to image coordinates as follows:
              $$
              \begin{align}
              x &= u \cdot width \\
              y &= (1 - v) \cdot height
              \end{align}
              $$
              Note the $(1 - v)$ because otherwise, the texture would be flipped upside down. <br>
              We can then get the RGB values from the image data array as follows:
              $$
              \begin{align}
              index &= (x + y \cdot width) \cdot num\_channels \\
              R &= image[index] / 255 \\
              G &= image[index+1] / 255 \\
              B &= image[index+2] / 255 \\
              \end{align}
              $$
              where $num\_channels$ is the number of channels in the image: 4 for RGBA images, and 3 for RGB images.
              The final color is also converted to linear RGB using the <code>nori::Color3f::toLinearRGB()</code>
              method.<br> <br>

              I also added a <code>scale</code> property, which allows to shrink (scale &gt; 1), and repeat the texture
              to fit the surface, or make it bigger (scale &lt; 1). <br>
              Furthermore, I added a <code>shift</code> property, which allows to translate the texture. This is for
              example useful to rotate the texture on a sphere.
            </p>

            <h3>Validation</h3>
            <p>To validate the implementation, I created identical scenes and rendered them in nori and <a
                href="https://mitsuba.readthedocs.io/en/latest/index.html">Mitsuba</a>. The images are almost identical,
              only the brightness is slightly different because nori and mitsuba use somewhat different values for the
              same light intensity. However, the textures are applied the identically.

            <p>Normal mapping can be used to fake the lighting of bumps and dents of meshes without adding more
              polygons.
            </p>

            <h3>Implementation</h3>
            <p>The normal map is an RGB image where each texel encodes the normal at that point: $normal = \left( 2
              \cdot
              color_{RGB} \right) - 1$. <br>
              Loading the image and mapping the $uv$ coordinate to image coordinates is done the same way as for the
              Image Textures. The only difference is that now the <code>eval()</code> method returns the normal vector
              instead of the color. <br>
              To apply the normal mapping, we do the following for each detected intersection:
            <ul>
              <li>Compute tangent and bitangent at intersection point. We want the tangent vector to be in the same
                direction as the texture coordinates. For this, I followed the steps explained in the <a
                  href="https://www.opengl-tutorial.org/intermediate-tutorials/tutorial-13-normal-mapping/">
                  OpenGL Normal Mapping</a> tutorial:
                $$
                \begin{align}
                deltaPos1 &= vertex_1 - vertex_0 \\
                deltaPos2 &= vertex_2 - vertex_0 \\
                deltaUV1 &= uv_1 - uv_0 \\
                deltaUV2 &= uv_2 - uv_0 \\
                r &= \frac{1}{deltaUV1_x \cdot deltaUV2_y - detlaUV1_y \cdot deltaUV2_x} \\
                tangent &= r \cdot (deltaPos1 \cdot deltaUV2_y - deltaPos2 \cdot deltaUV1_y) \\
                bitangent &= r \cdot (deltaPos2 \cdot deltaUV1_x - deltaPos1 \cdot deltaUV2_x)
                \end{align}
                $$
                where $detlaPos1, deltaPos2$ are polygon edges, and $deltaUV1, deltaUV2$ the edges in the uv space.
              </li>
              <li>Calculate the new normal at the intersection point using the normal map and the $uv$ coordinates:
                $new\_normal = \left( 2 \cdot color_{RGB} \right) - 1$
              </li>
              <li>Use the tangent, bitangent and the mesh normal to compute a tangent space coordinate frame,
                and then use this frame to convert the new normal to world coordinates.
              </li>
              <li>Set the converted normal as the mesh shading frame normal.</li>
            </ul>
            </p>

            <h3>Validation</h3>
            <p>
              To validate the implementation, I created identical scenes and rendered them in nori and <a
                href="https://mitsuba.readthedocs.io/en/latest/index.html">Mitsuba</a>. The first scene is an analytical
              sphere, and the second scene a mesh plane. Both containing a single pointlight source above the object.
              <br>
              The images are almost identical, only the brightness is again slightly different because nori and mitsuba
              use somewhat different values for the same light intensity. <br>
              The normal textures are applied identically, and the effect of the normal mapping is clearly visible,
              when comparing to only having the texture applied without normal mapping.
            </p>

            <h3>Implementation</h3>
            <p>For this feature, I modified the arealight to also accept a texture as the radiance. Now when sampling
              the emitter, it will use the uv coordinates to look up the color in the texture and return that
              value as the radiance. The lookup is the same as for Image Textures, described above. <br>
              To be able to lookup the texture, I added a <code>Point2f uv</code> property to the
              <code>EmitterQueryRecord</code> and to the <code>ShapeQueryRecord</code>. The <code>uv</code> property of
              the <code>EmitterQueryRecord</code> is updated in the <code>Integrator::Li</code> methods of the different
              integrators. This uv value is updated when the ray intersection point is an emitter. <br>
              The <code>uv</code> property of the <code>ShapeQueryRecord</code> is updated in the
              <code>Shape::sampleSurface</code> method in <code>mesh.cpp</code> and <code>sphere.cpp</code>.
              This uv value is updated when we sample a point on the emitter surface.
            </p>

            <h3>Validation</h3>
            <p>To validate the implementation, I created identical scenes and redered them in nori and <a
                href="https://mitsuba.readthedocs.io/en/latest/index.html">Mitsuba</a>. Both scenes contain either an
              analytical sphere or a mesh, and a ground plane. The sphere resp. mesh is the only emitter in the scene.
              The <code>path_mis</code> integrator with 64 samples per pixel was used to render the scene. <br>
              The images look very similar: The mean error between the images is only 0.003 for both scenes, calculated
              using the <a href="https://github.com/tom94/tev">tev</a> tool.

            <h3>Implementation</h3>
            <p>
              To perform NL means denoising, we need the pixel variance. To estimate the non-uniform pixel variance,
              I used the following formula:
              $$
              \begin{align}
              var[p] &= (\text{sample variance}) \cdot \frac{1}{n} \\
              &= \left( \left( \frac{\sum_{i=1}^n x_i^2}{n} - \left( \frac{\sum_{i=1}^n x_i}{n} \right)^2 \right)
              \cdot \frac{n}{n-1} \right) \cdot \frac{1}{n}
              \end{align}
              $$
              To estimate the variance, I updated the <code>RenderThread::renderScene</code> in <code>render.cpp</code>.
              Now when rendering a scene, it will also output a <code>image_variance.exr</code> file, containing the
              estimated variances. <br>
              I implemented the fast NL-means denoising algorithm given in the
              <a href="https://moodle-app2.let.ethz.ch/mod/resource/view.php?id=833825">lecture slides</a> in python,
              using opencv and numpy. The algorithm is well explained in the lecture slides. For the $d^2$ function,
              I used the non-uniform variance variant. <br>
              OpenCV is used to read and write the image files, and to apply the boxfilter convolution.
              Numpy is used to perform efficient array operations.
            </p>

            <h3>Validation</h3>
            <p>
              To validate the denoising, I rendered the cbox scene using the <code>path_mis</code> integrator,
              with 256 samples per pixel, which produced quite a noisy image. I also rendered the same scene
              with 8192 samples per pixel as a baseline to compare the denoised image to. <br>
              Rendering and denoising the 256 spp image (with $r=10, f=3, k=0.45$) took in total about 2.2 minutes
              (1.9 minutes for rendering and 0.3 minutes for denosing), while the 8192 spp took about 51 minutes to
              render. So, we have a speedup of around 23. <br>
              The denoised image looks very similar to the high spp version. However, there are some faint patterns
              visible, especially on the walls. With some parameter tweaking, those could probably be reduced even more,
              but this would also increase the denoising time.

              Participating media allows us to render clouds and fog. I implemented both homogeneous and
              heterogeneous participating media using a volumetric path tracer.
            </p>

            <div id="participatingMediaImplementation">
              <h3>Implementation</h3>
              <p>
                This feature was the most complicated to implement for me, and took the most amount of time to finish.
                For the implementation, I mainly followed the theory covered in the lecture slides and the PBR book.
              </p>

              <h4>Phase Function</h4>
              <p>
                To sample a new scattering direction, I implemented both the isotropic and Henyey Greenstein
                phase functions, as defined in the lecture slides. The pdf functions are as follows:
                $$
                \begin{align}
                f_{p\text{ISO}} (\vec{w}', \vec{w}) &= \frac{1}{4\pi} \\
                f_{p\text{HG}} (\theta) &= \frac{1}{4\pi} \frac{1 - g^2}{\left( 1 + g^2 - 2g \text{cos}(\theta)
                \right)^{3/2}} \\
                \text{where: } \; \; \text{cos}(\theta) &= \frac{1}{2g} \left( 1 + g^2 -
                \left( \frac{1 - g^2}{1 - g + 2g\xi} \right)^2 \right)
                \end{align}
                $$
              </p>

              <h4>Medium</h4>
              <p>
                The medium needs the ability to sample a free path and calculate the transmittance along a ray. <br>
                For the homogeneous medium, I first tried the simplified variant with $Tr(t) = e^{-\sigma_t \cdot t}$
                (<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Beer%E2%80%93Lambert_law">Beer-Lambert law)</a>,
                but I couldn't get it to work properly since this always resulted in a completely black medium. <br>
                Therefore, I am using Delta Tracking for both the homogeneous and heterogeneous medium.
                The idea is to start at the beginning of the ray and take a random step along the ray, according to
                $t \texttt{ += } -log(1 - \xi) \cdot inv\_max\_density / \sigma_t$. <br>
                To sample a free path, we continue Delta Tracking until we either exit the medium,
                or until $current\_density / max\_density \gt \xi$, where $\xi$ is a random number between 0 and 1.
                The first case means we have no medium interaction, while the second case indicates a medium
                interaction, and we return the $albedo$ color. <br>
                To calculate the transmittance, we continue Delta Tracking until we exit the medium, while in every
                iteration we update $t$ as before and also update the transmittance as:
                $tr \texttt{ *= } 1 - max(0, current\_density \cdot inv\_max\_density)$, where the initial value is $tr
                = 1$.
              </p>
              <p>
                Each medium is described by:
                $$
                \begin{align}
                \text{Absorption coefficient } & \sigma_a \\
                \text{Scattering coefficient } & \sigma_s \\
                \text{Extinction coefficient } & \sigma_t = \sigma_a + \sigma_s \\
                \text{Albedo } & \alpha = \sigma_s / \sigma_t
                \end{align}
                $$
              </p>

              <p>
                All media types use a bounding box, defined by the <code>center</code> and <code>size</code> xml scene
                parameters, to define where the medium should be placed. <br>
                While the density function for the homogeneous medium is always constant, for the heterogeneous medium
                it is spatially varying. For the homogeneous medium, we can specify the density with the
                <code>max_density</code> value in the xml scene file.
                For the heterogeneous medium, I added support for different density types, which can be specified with
                the <code>density_type</code> parameter:
              <ul>
                <li><b>Exponential:</b> $d(p) = max\_density \cdot exp(-b \cdot h)$, where $h$ is the height in the
                  direction
                  of the up-vector
                </li>
                <li><b>Volume Grid:</b> The density at a point is read from a volume grid (.nvdb) file</li>
                <li><b>Perlin Noise:</b> The density at a point is calculated using a 3D perlin noise function.
                  See <a href="#procedural">Procedural Volumes</a> for more information.</li>
              </ul>
              </p>

              <h5>Exponential</h5>
              <p>
                The exponential density function slowly decreases the density in the up direction. The parameter
                <code>b</code> and the up-direction vector <code>up_dir</code> can be specified in the xml file.
                This density function allows us to create nice foggy scenes.
              </p>

              <h5>Volume Grid</h5>
              <p>
                To read the density values from a volume grid file, I am using
                <a href="https://github.com/AcademySoftwareFoundation/openvdb/tree/master/nanovdb/nanovdb">NanoVDB</a>,
                which is a header-only library to read NanoVDB files, which are similar to
                <a href="https://www.openvdb.org/">OpenVDB</a> files. <br>
                To get the density of a specific point in our scene, I am first projecting the point inside our medium
                bounding box to the unit cube. Then I can use this position to determine the corresponding point
                inside the bounding box of the grid defined in the vdb file.
              </p>

              <h5>Perlin Noise</h5>
              <p>
                This was implemented by Eric as part of the Procedural Volumes feature.
                For implementation details, please have a look at
                <a href=#procedural> Eric's section on Procedural Volumes</a>.
              </p>

              <br>
              <h4>Volumetric Path Tracer</h4>
              <p>
                To render the participating medium, I implemented a Volumetric Path Tracer <code>vol_path</code>.
                I based this integrator on the <code>path_mis</code> integrator implemented as part of the homeworks,
                and added the functionality to handle medium interaction. <br>
                First, we sample a random medium which the ray intersects. For this medium, we sample the free path,
                and if we detect a medium interaction, we sample a random emitter. If the emitter is visible from the
                sampled medium point, we calculate the transmittance along the shadowray through all media in the scene
                by multiplying each transmittance value together. <br>
                We then use the phase function to sample a new direction for the recursive ray. If the new intersection
                point is an emitter, we update the $w_{mat}$ value similar to how it's done in the
                <code>path_mis</code> integrator. <br>
                If we have no medium interaction, we basically do the same as in the <code>path_mis</code> integrator,
                while also including the calculated transmittance along the ray.
              </p>

              <p>Below is the pseudocode for the volumetric path tracer:</p>
              <pre><code>Li = 0, t = 1
while (true) {
    medium = scene.getRandomMedium()
    albedo = scene.sampleFreePath()

    if (mediumInteraction) {
        russianRoulette()
        t *= albedo
        Vector3f scatterDirection
        pdf_mat = medium.phaseFunction().sample(scatterDirection)
        randomEmitter = scene.getRandomEmitter()

        if (!shadowRayOccluded) {
            Color3f Tr = 1
            for (med : scene.getAllMedia()) {
                Tr *= med.Tr(shadowRay)
            }

            // update pdf_em and w_em

            Li += t * Tr * randomEmitter.sample() * numEmitters * pdf_mat
        }

        recursiveRay = Ray3f(mediumInteractionPoint, scatterDirection)

        // update w_mat
    }
    else if (!mediumInteraction && !surfaceInteraction) {
        break
    }
    else {
        // add contribution from material sampling
        //    including transmittance
        
        russianRoulette()

        // add contribution from emitter sampling
        //    including transmittance
        //    update w_em

        // update recursiveRay
        
        // update w_mat
    }
}</code></pre>
            </div>

              <h4>Volumetric Path Tracer</h4>
              <p>
                To validate my volumetric path tracer, I rendered identical scenes without any participating media

            <h3>Implementation</h3>
            <p>For this special light source, I used the implementation of the book. Unfortunately, I could not make use
              of the bounding box of the scene.
              In the implementation, I am currently using a hardcoded value for the radius. This overestimates the power
              of the light a bit but still gives good results.
            </p>

            <h3>Validation</h3>
            <p>To validate the implementation, we created identical scenes and rendered them in nori and <a
                href="https://mitsuba.readthedocs.io/en/latest/index.html">Mitsuba</a>. Both scenes contain two meshes
              and a ground plane. The direction of the light source and the color
              of the light are the same. The two images show no differences with this direction of the light. In other
              cases, our implementation resultet in a slightly brighter picture because
              of the overestimation described above.

            <h3>Implementation</h3>
            <p>The implementation of this feature was hard. There is no information about it in the PBRT book and the
              blog
              posts online did not help me well either.
              The basic behind this type of motion blur is obviously that the camera needs to move in some way. At
              first,
              I tried to do this by hand, meaning that I setup my own transformation matrices and then multiplied them
              with the camera's matrix.
              This did not work at all and I had to use a simpler approach where I defined the transformation matrix
              directly in the xml file. This means that for motionblur we need to specify the point where the camera
              will
              move to.
              As we already have defined the origin of the camera, I programmed some sort of interpolation between the
              two
              matrices. The camera will move a tiny bit towards the final position depending on the contribution of the
              sample. This contribution factor is based
              on the value of $m_{progress}$ which is defined in the <code>render.cpp</code>file.
            </p>
            <h3>Validation</h3>
            <p> Validation for this type of blur is purely visually. For the scene, I let the camera move a small
              fraction
              to the side. The blur applies instantly and is very intense. In the renderer one can notice the movement
              of
              the camera and its effect on the bluriness.</p>

            <h3>Implementation</h3>
            <p>I implemented this feature together with Gianluca as he is the creator of the Heterogeneous Participating
              Media. After he explained me the functions and files, it was significantly easier to implement the
              procedural volume. For the feature, I created a new header file for perlin noise with the help of an
              existing github repo. To add the noise to the medium, I define a new type of density that is calculated
              with the 3D perlin noise.
            </p>
            <p>To apply the density, I can choose between a cube and a sphere. More complex shapes are not supported.
            </p>
            <h3>Validation</h3>
            <p> I created Perlin spheres and cubes and varied the frequency and density parameters inside the cbox
              scene.</p>

            </dl>

            <h3>Implementation</h3>
            <p> For the implementation, I followed the approach of the book.
              First, as the Environment Map is just an infinite arealight, I cloned the file and began to modify it.
              In the constructor, I build the Environment Map using the <code> Bitmap("filename")</code> method. With
              this
              bitmap,
              I directly build a matrix of intensities and use this matrix to calculate the row-PDF, row-CDF as well as
              the 2D conditional PDF and CDF.
            </p>
            <p> For the <code>sample()</code> method, I first applied discrete sampling (unlike continuous sampling
              which
              is used in the book) to find the {i,j}-coordinates.
              Then I mapped these coordinates to $\theta$ and $\phi$ to be able to call
              <code> sphericalDirection(theta,phi)</code> and set <code>lRec.wi</code> of the EmitterQueryRecord.
              With this information I was able to calculate the Jacobian matrix and the final return value.
            </p>
            <p> For the <code>eval()</code> and <code> pdf()</code> methods, I calculate the u and v coordinates
              given the EmitterQueryRecord using the approach from the <code>sphere.cpp</code> file. Given the
              coordinates, we can access values of the bitmap and the conditional PDF/CDF matrices.
              In the <code> eval() </code> method, I first tried to average the neighboring pixels by myself.
              Unfortunately, with this approach
              I created a blur filter and the resulting images were not pretty to look at. After doing some more
              research,
              I decided to use bilinear interpolation.
              With the help of two blog posts mentioned above in the Theory listing</a>, I managed to implement the
              necessary formula with some
              minor adjustments for out-of-bounds errors. The resulting image was now less blurry than before, but I was
              not satisfied. In an effort to create
              an unblurred alternative, I set a new boolean property which lets the user decide
              whether he wants to use interpolation or not to find the {u,v}-values.
              If the flag is not set, I will simply do the following:
            <pre><code> 
              if(!m_interpolate){
                int u = int(round(x));
                int v = int(round(y));
                return m_envBitMap(u,v);
              }</code>
          </pre>
            The direct approach is faster in terms of rendering and results in images that are less blurred compared to
            interpolation.
            As this might come in handy for the final image, I was eager to leave this option in the final code.
            </p>

            <h3>Validation</h3>
            <p>To validate the implementation, we created identical scenes and rendered them in nori and <a
                href="https://mitsuba.readthedocs.io/en/latest/index.html">Mitsuba</a>. Both scenes contain a dielectric
              sphere in the middle and an environment map. The images look very similar but the most noticable
              difference
              is the blur in my own implementation. There are also some small differences in spots that are very intense
              in terms of light.
            </p>
            <p>
              The first images uses an Environment map with a 2K-Resolution. The rendering is relatively fast: It takes
              about 20 seconds.
              The second image uses an Environment map with a 4K-Resolution. The rendering is slow: It takes about 2
              minutes to complete.

            <h3>Implementation</h3>
            <h4>Depth of Field</h4>
            <p> For DoF I followed the implementation of the PBRT book which explains the process very clearly. Thanks
              to
              the book I managed to implement this feature very quick. </p>

            <h4>Lens Distortion</h4>
            <p> For the distortion, I did not find any good information in the book. After doing some research on the
              topic and seeing the same formula over and over again, I implemented a simple but effective way to distort
              the lens.
              For this, I need two warping parameters $K_1$ and $K_2$ and also the norm of the x and y coordinates on
              the
              camera's near plane.
              Then, I simply calculate the distortion value with the following function:
            <pre>
              <code> 
              float distortionFunction(float r) const{

            and multiply the x and y coordinates on the near plane with this value.
            </p>

            <h4>Bokeh</h4>
            <p> Bokeh was hard to implement as there were simply no resources available in the book. As always I did
              some
              research and found that bokeh is a special type of blur occuring usually with depth of field.
              To implement the feature, I coupled it with DoF: Meaning that bokeh only works in settings where DoF is
              enabled. For the effect, I modified the warping method that is used in DoF. I calculate an offset for each
              point <code>Point2f offset = 2.f * sample - Vector2f(1, 1);</code>
              and then apply concentric disk sampling directly. This allows for bokeh in its circular form - which in my
              opinion is the most beautiful and relevant one. </p>

            <h3>Validation</h3>
            <p> For DoF, since I followed the implementation of the book, I wanted to confirm my work with the <a
                href="https://mitsuba.readthedocs.io/en/latest/index.html">Mitsuba</a> renderer. For this I created a
              simple scene with a plane and a skull. I switched between a short and a long focal distance to get an
              image
              where the skull is in focus and one where it is not. The effect seems to work but my pictures are less
              bright, which is due to the light source intensity. </p>

            <p>The following scenes were created without a sibling in Mitsuba. The scene consists of multiple teapots.
              In
              the first image, the focal distance is kept short: The focus point is more towards the left side of the
              picture, where the teapots are close. The first image is crossed with an image of the same focal distance
              but a different lens radius. The second image has a larger focal length: Its focus point shifts more to
              the
              right of the picture.</p>

            <br>
            <br>
            <p>Bokeh Images were rendered using a distant light source that shines on multiple spheres. I fixed the
              focal
              length and increased the lens radius three times. The bokeh effect is only noticable for very blurry
              images
              -
              which is conformant with the real bokeh effect in photography.
              The validation of this feature is purely visual. </p>

              that
              the feature does what it should.</p>

            <h3>Implementation</h3>
            <p> Out of the 10 possible parameters, I implemented specular, metallic, roughness, sheen and clearcoat. For
              most of them, I used the original disney paper as reference. Since sheen is only mentioned briefly in the
              disney paper,
              I additionaly took inspiration from a blog post on the Disney BSDF. For specular and clearcoat, I
              implemented new warping functions called GTR1 and GTR2 (Generalized-Trowbridge-Reit distributions). I also
              added more than the 5 required parameters to my model because I wanted to see the effects of them in
              action.
            </p>
            <p>
              For clearcoat, I was not happy with the implementation that the Disney paper proposed. Officially, the
              term
              looks like this: <code>(m_clearcoat * Gr * Fr * Dr) * 0.25</code> where the intensity is
              only $0.25$ and the effect of clearcoat is not visible without sliding the exposure up to 100%. To counter
              this, I simply
              added a new variable <code> (m_clearcoat * Gr * Fr * Dr) * m_clearcoatIntensity </code>. This variable is
              currently hardcoded at $1.5$ and gives (in my opinion) a much better and clearer clearcoat effect.
            </p>
            <p>
              For sheen, as mentioned above, I did not find a lot of useful information in the disney paper. The
              original
              idea for it is given only in the appendix of the paper and after using said idea, I was not happy with the
              result. I then did some research online and found a blog post that proposed a slightly different formula
              for
              sheen.
              I implemented it but sadly was not able to reconstruct the effect so clearly as it is depicted on the
              disney reference image.
            </p>
            <h3>Validation</h3>
            <p> For the Validation of the new warping functions, I changed the warptest file accordingly and ran the
              tests. Both warping functions succeeded.
            </p>

            <p>
              For the actual disney parameters, I setup a scene with five teapots and increased the parameter strength
              from left to right. The other parameters were held constant. For clearcoat, as mentioned above, I changed
              the factor such that the effect is better visible.
